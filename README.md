# **SAGE: AI-Powered Sustainability Chatbot**  

SAGE (**Sustainable Advisory & Guidance Expert**) is an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to provide intelligent insights on sustainability. This project features **two versions** of SAGE:  

- **DistilBERT-Based Chatbot:** Utilizes **intent recognition and NLP** for structured responses.  
- **GPT-Powered Chatbot:** Leverages **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 API** to generate dynamic, context-aware answers.  

By comparing both versions, we analyze their **accuracy, response quality, and effectiveness** in aiding sustainability decision-making.  

üåç Whether you're exploring **eco-friendly solutions**, **carbon footprints**, or **sustainable lifestyle choices**, SAGE has you covered!

## **Setup & Requirements**  

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  

If you're using Conda, create or update your environment:

```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml  # For new environment
conda env update --file requirements.yml --prune  # Update existing environment
```

If you only want to install via pip, use:

```bash
pip install -r <(echo "$(sed 's/- /--/' requirements.yml | sed 's/^dependencies:/ /g' | sed 's/pip:/ /g')")
```

**üìå Ensure you have an OpenAI API Key for GPT Mode!**  
To use the **GPT-powered chatbot**, create an **API key** from OpenAI's website:  

üîó **Visit:** [https://platform.openai.com/signup/](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)  
üìå **Copy your API Key and replace it in the `GPT_GUI.py` file**  

```python
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'  # Replace this with your actual API key
```

## **How to Compile & Run SAGE**  

### **Running the Chatbot with OpenAI API**  
For an all-in-one execution, use:  
```bash
make all
```

### **Step-by-Step Execution**  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Train the DistilBERT Chatbot**  
Before running SAGE, train the NLP-based chatbot:  
```bash
make train
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the DistilBERT Chatbot**  
Once trained, start the interactive chatbot:  
```bash
make chat
```

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Use the GPT-Powered Chatbot**  
To test the **ChatGPT-enhanced** version of SAGE:  
```bash
make gptui
```

## **How SAGE Works**  

SAGE operates in two modes:  

### üîπ **DistilBERT Chatbot:**  
- Loads a **pre-trained model** and predefined **intent-response pairs**.  
- Uses NLP classification to **predict user intent** and generate responses.  
- Provides **structured, rule-based answers**.  

### üîπ **GPT-Powered Chatbot:**  
- Uses **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 API** to process natural language queries.  
- Generates **context-aware, dynamic responses** based on user input.  
- Enhances conversation flow with **AI-driven reasoning and deeper insights**.  

By comparing the two models, SAGE explores the advantages of **rule-based AI** vs. **deep learning-based conversational AI** in addressing **sustainability queries**.

## **User Experience & Expected Output**  

üñ•Ô∏è **Graphical Interface:**  
- A **user-friendly** chatbot window  

üí¨ **Interacting with SAGE:**  
- **Type a question & hit enter** ‚Üí Your query disappears, and SAGE provides an AI-generated response.  
- **Click "Exit"** ‚Üí The chatbot closes gracefully.  

**ü§ñ GPT Mode Features:**  
- Handles **complex and open-ended queries** better than the DistilBERT model.  
- Generates **long-form, contextual answers** based on AI training data.  
- Uses **real-time GPT interaction** instead of predefined responses.

## **Key Insights & Findings**  

üìå **Comparison of DistilBERT & GPT Models**  

| Feature                  | DistilBERT Chatbot | GPT-3.5 Chatbot |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Response Type**        | Rule-based        | Contextual & Dynamic |
| **Accuracy**             | High for structured queries | Adaptive & evolving |
| **Training Needed?**     | Yes (pre-trained NLP model) | No (API-based AI) |
| **Best Use Case**        | Quick predefined answers | Deep, AI-driven explanations |

üéØ **SAGE in Action:**  
- üü¢ **Answered sustainability queries** effectively using **both AI techniques**.  
- üü¢ **Compared response accuracy & quality** through user testing.  
- üü¢ **Validated AI's role in sustainability guidance** by analyzing user interactions.
