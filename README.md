### **SAGE: AI-Powered Sustainability Chatbot**  

SAGE (**Sustainable Advisory & Guidance Expert**) is an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to provide intelligent insights on sustainability. This project features **two versions** of SAGE:  

- **DistilBERT-Based Chatbot:** Utilizes **intent recognition and NLP** for structured responses.  
- **GPT-Powered Chatbot:** Leverages **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API** to generate dynamic, context-aware answers.  

By comparing both versions, we analyze their **accuracy, response quality, and effectiveness** in aiding sustainability decision-making.  

🌍 Whether you're exploring **eco-friendly solutions**, **carbon footprints**, or **sustainable lifestyle choices**, SAGE has you covered!

## **How to Compile & Run SAGE**  

### **Running the Chatbot with OpenAI API**  
For an all-in-one execution, use:  
```bash
make all
```

### **Step-by-Step Execution**  

#### **1️⃣ Train the DistilBERT Chatbot**  
Before running SAGE, train the NLP-based chatbot:  
```bash
make train
```

#### **2️⃣ Launch the DistilBERT Chatbot**  
Once trained, start the interactive chatbot:  
```bash
make chat
```

#### **3️⃣ Use the GPT-Powered Chatbot**  
To test the **ChatGPT-enhanced** version of SAGE:  
```bash
make gptui
```

## **How SAGE Works**  

SAGE operates in two modes:  

🔹 **DistilBERT Chatbot:**  
  - Loads a **pre-trained model** and predefined **intent-response pairs**.  
  - Uses NLP classification to **predict user intent** and generate responses.  
  - Provides **structured, rule-based answers**.  

🔹 **GPT-Powered Chatbot:**  
  - Uses **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API** to process natural language queries.  
  - Generates **context-aware, dynamic responses** based on user input.  
  - Enhances conversation flow with **AI-driven reasoning and deeper insights**.  

By comparing the two models, SAGE explores the advantages of **rule-based AI** vs. **deep learning-based conversational AI** in addressing **sustainability queries**.

## **User Experience & Expected Output**  

🖥️ **Graphical Interface:**  
- A **user-friendly** chatbot window 

💬 **Interacting with SAGE:**  
- **Type a question & hit enter** → Your query disappears, and SAGE provides an AI-generated response.  
- **Click "Exit"** → The chatbot closes gracefully.  


🤖 **GPT Mode Features:**  
- Handles **complex and open-ended queries** better than the DistilBERT model.  
- Generates **long-form, contextual answers** based on AI training data.  
- Uses **real-time GPT interaction** instead of predefined responses.
